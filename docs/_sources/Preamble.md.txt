# Preamble

These examples constitutes a complete distortion QA example, starting from dicom images and ending with a distortion report.

Each step is split into two sections. In the first, a simple example of using the code is demonstrated. Only the first section need be completed to move on to the next step. The second section provides more detailed examples and notes on each step, including how to handle some of the trick situation which may arise.

In general, this workflow is designed to be modular and you can jump in/out at whatever point you please. But for the examples, we recomend completing them in order, because some of the future steps rely on data created in the former steps! 

These examples are not intended to demonstate every possible thing you can do with this code and explain how to handle every edge case; for that you should look at the code documentation.
